# pizzaapp
from June 13, 2018
In this app, we asked the customer now many pizzas he wants, and then toppings are randomly selected, one from each of six categories.

I learned how to set up an array, and the .sample method of randomly selecting an element from that array. Later, we were assigned to take a user-generator order and figure out the price and other details.

The status, as of 9:55 p.m. on June 14: I accept 3 different sizes and 3 different crusts (no charge). 

My next tasks are to compute prices based on sizes and toppings, also adding delivery charges and state taxes.
