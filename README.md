# pizzaapp
from June 13, 2018
In this app, we asked the customer now many pizzas he wants, and then toppings are randomly selected, one from each of six categories.

I learned how to set up an array, and the .sample method of randomly selecting an element from that array. Later, we were assigned to take a user-generator order and figure out the price and other details.

The status, as of 9:55 p.m. on June 14: I accept 3 different sizes and 3 different crusts (no charge). I take delivery and carryout, and compute state tax, delivery charge and let the customer add a tip.

What I have NOT yet done is ask for toppings and charge for those. I haven't error-proofed, as I did in a previous project.
