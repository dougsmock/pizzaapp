# pizzaapp
From June 13, 2018, with later improvments.

In this app, we ask the customer now many pizzas he wants, and have select one of four crusts, and then pick from an array of toppings and add special requests.

The goals are to output customer's order and handle the different demands of delivery vs. carryout, and to compute the total price (including sales tax, delivery fee and tip). The subtotal is given after every pizza, which also helps the customer and the retailer to keep track as the order goes along. That makes it easier to program the total price, in my opinion.

Just for fun, at Marvin's suggestion, I made a randomized entry for delivery time, from 20 to 50 minutes.
